In this experiment, I sent only 784 weight values, which are related to the estimation of the 3rd number, to the offset address of the address where I sent the weight values. And I checked the first address of the register address where I read the result output.

As a result, I got the correct predictive value.

You can try this experiment by taking the values in the "Third-784-weightes" txt file and running it in the c code in the "784 weight" folder.
