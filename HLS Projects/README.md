**In this repo, Vivado HLS 2017.4 is used.**

In order to create an IP Core in Vivado HLS, the target device must be selected. For this reason, separate IP cores have been created for the PYNQ Z2 and ZEDBOARD SOC Development Boards.

In order to create an IP core for each device, you can read the README in the relevant folder.
